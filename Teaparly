# Introduction

Hello, I'll be keeping this short for you.

I'm mainly around near on the right of the Cafe, but do feel welcome to say hi; I'm always open to start a conversation.

Friend requests are always accepted.

English is not my first language, therefore I keep my literature simple.

I tend to be off the game, but please do throw in a whisper and I'll be back with you. I tend to often keep my status accurate.

Writing, animating and drawing are my best skills, alongside with role-playing.

Roblox joins are always on, under the same username I adopted, Teaparly, friend requests are open.

Thank you,


Karl
